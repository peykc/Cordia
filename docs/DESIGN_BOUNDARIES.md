# What Cordia is *not*

Cordia is designed with clear boundaries. This document spells out what the project **will not** do and what it is **not** designed for.

## Identity & discovery

- **No government ID** — Cordia does not require or verify real-world identity.
- **No real names required** — Display names only; your real name is optional and never required.
- **No public discovery** — There is no global user directory or search. You join servers via invite links or friend codes, not by browsing.

## Data & privacy

- **Beacon does not read message content** — The Beacon does not inspect, understand, or retain message contents. It handles routing metadata only (presence, discovery, signaling).
- **No social graph monetization** — Cordia does not build, sell, or monetize social graphs.

## Scale & scope

- **Not designed for massive communities** — Cordia targets smaller groups. Very large servers and huge voice calls are out of scope.
- **No paywalls** — Core features are not gated by monetization. If your setup can run it and you have internet, you get full functionality.

These boundaries are intentional. Cordia prioritizes privacy, simplicity, and functionality over scale and business models.
